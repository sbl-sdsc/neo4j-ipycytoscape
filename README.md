# neo4j-ipycytoscape

This repo demonstrates how to use the [ipycytoscape widget](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape) to visualize a Neo4j subgraph with cytoscape.js in JupyterLab and the Jupyter notebook.

### Launch Jupyter Lab on [Pangeo Binder](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.ia/)

**NOTE:** Authentication is now required to launch binder! Sign into GitHub from your browser, then click on the `launch binder` badge below to launch Jupyter Lab.

[![Binder](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.ia/badge_logo.svg)](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.ia/v2/gh/sbl-sdsc/neo4j-ipycytoscape/master)

|Notebook|Description|
|:-------|:----------|
|[Neo4j_Example1](notebooks/Neo4j_Example1.ipynb)| Creates a small Neo4j graph locally and demonstrates how to display a Neo4j subgraph|
|[Neo4j_Example2](notebooks/Neo4j_Example2.ipynb)| Accesses the  COVID-19-Net Knowledge Graph server and demonstrates how to display a Neo4j subgraph|

When running this project on [Pangeo Binder](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.ia/), a Neo4j database server is [setup](../binder/postBuild) and [started](../binder/start). This may take a few minutes.

#### Local Neo4j installation
When running Neo4j_Example1.ipynb locally, you need to install and start the Neo4j database:

1. [Download Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/)
2. Launch Neo4j Browser
3. Create a new database
4. Set password to "neo4jbinder"
5. Start database
